# NetWork_Analysis

This project aims to identify flavor network and food pairing hypothesis among different regions by utilizing network analysis.
A dataset contains all recipies and another dataset contains the shared compound between flavors are used in this porject. Data can be downloaded from: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196


Three main parts are conducted in the analysis:
1. Centrality measurement: degree, closeness, betweenness
2. Statistical Analysis: Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
3. Similarity: Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity


Main Results from the project include:
1. East Asian cuisines tend to use fewer ingredients that share more compounds.
2. American and European cuisines share more flavor compounds.


Other contributors include: Jenny Jiang, Eric Goldy, Gar Gao
